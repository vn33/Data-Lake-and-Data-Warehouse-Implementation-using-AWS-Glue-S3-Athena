    "Assume you work as a Data Engineer at a retailer specializing in scale models of classic cars and other transportation. The data analysts are interested in conducting trend analysis for the top products reviewed in Amazon, to inform new product development. Recently, your team acquired Amazon toy review data and product info, and stored them in a data lake bucket. You are asked to clean the data and ensure its accessibility, so that the data analysts can retrieve the data with SQL-based queries. For the initial testing phase, the team has opted to use AWS Glue ETL for the initial data cleaning, and Amazon Athena to query the data. "

    "## 5 - Data Catalog with Glue Crawler\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Glue Crawler is a powerful automated tool offered by AWS Glue for discovering and cataloging metadata about data sources, which enables services like Glue and Athena to query data directly from different sources. By simply pointing the crawler to your data source, whether it's a database or a data lake, it will automatically scan and extract the schema information, data types, and other relevant metadata. This metadata is then organized and stored in a database table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog, providing a centralized repository for understanding and managing your data assets. In this lab, you will create a crawler that will be in charge of populating the Glue Data Catalog with the newly transformed data in S3, you will be able to query the data directly from S3 using Athena in the final part.\n",

    "## 7 - Optional Experiments: Partitioning and Compression Features of Parquet Format\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compression**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Parquet format, commonly used in data lake architectures, supports various [compression codecs](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/data-pages/compression/) such as Snappy, Gzip, and LZO. These codecs play a crucial role in reducing the storage space needed by Parquet files. However, they come with a trade-off: while they reduce storage costs and optimize resource utilization, they can also impact processing speeds during data ingestion, transformation, and querying. To test this with a practical example, you will store the same transformed data using three different compression options: `UNCOMPRESSED`, `SNAPPY` and `GZIP`: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `UNCOMPRESSED`: Data is left uncompressed.\n",
    "- `SNAPPY`: Snappy is a fast compression/decompression library that works well with Parquet files. It provides good compression ratios and is optimized for speed. Snappy compression is often a good choice for balancing compression efficiency and query performance.\n",
    "- `GZIP`: Gzip is a widely used compression algorithm that provides high compression ratios. However, it tends to be slower in both compression and decompression compared to Snappy. Gzip compression can achieve higher levels of compression but may result in slower query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partitioning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning in Parquet is a technique used to better organize data within Parquet files based on partition keys. By partitioning data, Parquet optimizes query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned during query execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiments**\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the compression features, you will process the product metadata 3 times; in each time, you will choose a different option for the compression algorithm with no partitioning as shown in the left table here. Then you will compare for this data, \"uncompressed versus Snappy\" and then \"Snappy versus Gzip\". \n",
    "\n",
    "To explore the partitioning features, you will process the review dataset 3 times; in each time, you will choose a different option for the partitioning column, with Snappy for compression. Then you will compare for this data, \"partitioning versus no partitioning\" and then \"partitioning by year and month\" versus \"partitioning by the product id (asin)\".\n",
